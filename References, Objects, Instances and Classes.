References, Objects, Instances and Classes.
A class is a blueprint or a plan.
Each object of the class is an instance.
The address of the class is the reference. The reference can be copied many times but copying the reference doesn't copy the object or class.
References can be passed to parameters and constructors.

House blueHouse = new House("blue");
House anotherHouse = blueHouse;

Line seven creates a new instance of the House Class.
Line eight creates a new reference to the House Class.

Objects are instances of the class in memory.
