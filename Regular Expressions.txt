        Using a regular expression in java requires importing the regex class.
        The matcher and pattern classes need to be imported, for the purposes
        of this study session they were all imported with the *.
        import java.util.regex.Pattern;
        import java.util.regex.Matcher;

        Delimiters are forward slashes /abc/
        This would search for the text "abc".

        Modes:
        Standard: /re/
        Global: /re/g     searches for all the matches.
        Case insensitive: re/i
        Multiline: re/m

        Metacharacters allow us to form expressions.
        They are as follows, \.* + - {} [] | ? () : ! =
        Metacharacters can have multiple meanings.

        Wildcard.
        .     Any character expect for a new line.
        For example /h.t/ will match hat, hated and hot but not match heat.
        Be careful of using the wildcard to represent an actual period as it
        will represent the period and every other character.

        \ backslash is for escaping metacharacters. After it the next character
        Will be taken as a literal. For example a \. will only return a
        period, not act as a wildcard. For a literal backslash use two escape
        characters. \\
        Never escape a literal because it could assign them a meaning.

	\r is a line return.
	\n is a new line. This will let you capture text accross multiple lines. Each line requires another \n.
	\r\n is both.
	
	Regular Expression 
	/c\nd/g

	Text example
	abc
	def
	This will capture the c from the first line and the d from the second line.

	Character Sets
	Character sets match one of several characters.
	For example /gr[ea]y/ matches any one vowel.
	This would match grey or gray but not great as it only matches the first character.

	Character Ranges
	Uses the - metacharacter.
	Includes all characters between two characters.
	Only works inside a character set, otherwise it's a literall.
	\[0-9]\ For all the numbers.
	\[A-Za-z]\ For all letters uppercase and lowercase.
	This is not a number range, it's a character range. So [50-99] would still be 0-9.

	Negative Metacharacter.
	^	Means it's not any one of several characters. Or the not! function in java.
	Using the ^ doesn't include an empty character, it's still looking for a character.
	\see[^mn]\ Wouldn't match the word "see" because it's still looking for something after.
	It would however match "see." or match "see " with a period or a space because those are characters.
	
	Shorthand Character Sets
	\d is for digit. It's the same as [0-9].
	\w is for word. It matches [a-zA-Z0-9_].
	\s is for whitespace, aka spaces. It matches [\t\r\n].
	Capitalizing the letter makes is the negative(not).

	Repition Metacharacters
	* + ?
	These are always placed after the chacter. For example /.+/g
	* Preceding item, zero or more times.
	+ Preceding item, one or more times.
	? Preceding item, zero or one time.
	.+ is a common useage as it will give you any characters, as long as there is at least one.
